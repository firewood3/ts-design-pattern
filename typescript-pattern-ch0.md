# Typescript Design Pattern

1. Tools and Frameworks
    - introduction to tools
    - installing a TypeScript compiler
    - a basic workflow
2. The Challenge of Increasing Complexity
    - starts with a simple server-client synchronizing implementation
    - how that complexity can be reduced
3. Creational Design Patterns
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype and Singleton
4. Structural Design Patterns
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - FacÌ§ade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy
5. Behavioral Design Patterns
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Memento
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
6. Behavioral Design Patterns: cuntinue
    - Strategy
    - State
    - Template Method
    - Observer
    - Visitor
7. Patterns and Architectures in JavaScript and TypeScript
    - takes a look at the patterns and architectures that closely relate to the language (JavaScript or TypeScript) and its application
    - including asynchronous programming, module organization, error handling, permission abstraction, and so on. 
8. SOLID Principles
    - Single respnsibility
    - Open-closed
    - Liskov substitution
    - Interface segregation
    - Dependency inversion 
9. The Road to Enterprise Application
    - guides readers to build the complete workflow of an application that is ready to scale
    - including testing and continuous integration.
